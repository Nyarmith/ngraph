# ncurses app framework

### How it Works
1. Create a cursapp class
2. Create windows for that class
3. Add entities and handlers to your windows
4. .run() the cursapp class

### TODO:
1. Create game-like test-cases
2. Make tests pass
3. Create conan package
4. Make the event-handler-in-separate-thread thing dima was talking about(it can refresh 30fps if it's a game)
5. Make real-time mode work well over ssh tunnel
6. Add optional global border[s] setting
