# ncurses app framework

### How it Works
1. Create a cursapp class
2. Create windows for that class
3. Add entities and handlers to your windows
4. .run() the cursapp class

### TODO:
1. Create generic gui classes
2. Create game-like test-cases
3. Make app instance a singleton
4. Make tests pass
5. Create conan package
6. Make the event-handler-in-separate-thread thing dima was talking about(it can refresh 30fps if it's a game)
7. Make test that shows ncurses bstates in hex side-by-side
